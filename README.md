# Circle 

**Ciclr is a lightweight distributed task processing software developed by Golang, which can obtain WeChat task list, process WeChat task status, and simulate WeChat reading.**


# Why this project was created ?

**There are such perverted companies. Ask employees to download the vibration app to share the company's articles on WeChat Moments and WeChat groups. As an employee performance appraisal. Such a rubbish company doing something meaningless. So to help my wife lighten the burden. Just developed this script to handle that damn boring task.**
